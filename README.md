# 😊Emote😞
"😊Emote😞" is a social network site with a twist: you can only post/comment using exclusively emojis. So instead of saying 
'I love this photo' you could express it as '📸❤️😍.' Additionally, if you're stuck on which emojis to choose, you can 
use the built-in AI translator to convert your plaintext to emojis.

## Todo
- [x] Rough wireframes sketched on pen and paper
- [x] ER diagram 
- [x] Plan endpoints
- [ ] Build the backend with express.js, implementing endpoints one by one using the plan
- [ ] Build the frontend with react, implement pages one by one using the wireframes
