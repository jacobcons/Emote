# üòäEmoteüòû

"üòäEmoteüòû" is a social network site with a twist: you can only post/comment using exclusively emojis. So instead of saying
'I love this photo' you could express it as 'üì∏‚ù§Ô∏èüòç.' Additionally, if you're stuck on which emojis to choose, you can
use the built-in AI translator to convert your plaintext to emojis.

This is just the backend API built with Node, Express.js and PostgreSQL. 

If you're interested you can read a writeup I did about some of the key technical decisions I had to make whilst building
this project on my [blog](https://jacobcons.com/blog/technical-decisions-whilst-making-emote/).

## Features

- Personal user profile
- Feed of friends posts
- React to posts using various emojis
- Comment on posts
- Full friend request system
- Translate plaintext into pure emojis using chat-gpt with OpenAi API
