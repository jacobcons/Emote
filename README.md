# 😊Emote😞
"😊Emote😞" is a social network site with a twist: you can only post/comment using exclusively emojis. So instead of saying
'I love this photo' you could express it as '📸❤️😍.' Additionally, if you're stuck on which emojis to choose, you can
use the built-in AI translator to convert your plaintext to emojis.

This is just the backend API built with Node, Express.js and PostgreSQL
